By 2070, 2 billion to 3.5 billion people will be living in climates that may be too hot for humans, according to a study in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Most of those affected will be the poor, who can't afford air conditioning.

With every 1 degree Celsius increase in global average annual temperature, about a billion people will end up in areas that are too warm to live in without cooling technology, according to study co-author Marten Scheffer of Wageningen University in the Netherlands.

The worst possible outcomes for both climate change and population growth would mean around 3.5 billion people living in extremely hot areas. That would be a third of the predicted global population in 2070.

Many climate scientists say the worst-case outcome seems less likely these days. However, better outcomes would still see several billion people living in places that would be too hot without air conditioning.

The researchers studied humans like they do bears, birds and bees to find the "climate niche" where people and civilizations are generally most successful. They looked back 6,000 years to find the best temperature range for humans: Average annual temperatures between 11 and 15 C.

We can — and do — live in warmer and colder places than that, but the farther from that ideal range, the harder it gets.

Currently about 20 million people live in places with an annual average temperature greater than 29 C. That area is less than 1% of the Earth's land, and it is mostly near the Sahara Desert and includes Mecca, Saudi Arabia.

But as the world gets more crowded and warmer, the study predicted that large parts of Africa, Asia, South America and Australia will likely be in this same temperature range, affecting up to 3.5 billion people.

Places like Nigeria — with a poorer population that is expected to triple by the end of the century — would be less able to cope, said study co-author Tim Lenton of the University of Exeter in England.
Hardt Hyperloop, a Dutch technology company, has worked with the province of North Holland to study plans for a hyperloop between Amsterdam and Paris.

The study found that passengers on a hyperloop could get from Amsterdam to Brussels in less than half an hour, or to Paris in an hour and a half. Today, going from Amsterdam to Brussels by train takes about two hours, and it's almost three and a half hours to Paris.

Billionaire Elon Musk first started talking about hyperloops in 2012. It's an idea for a new kind of public transport, similar to a train, where pods travel through tubes that have very little air inside them. With less air to slow them down, the pods could go over 950 kilometers an hour – twice as fast as the world's fastest train, and almost as fast as the speed of sound.

By making it faster and easier for workers to travel between large cities in nearby countries, the study found that a hyperloop could increase North Holland's gross domestic product (GDP) by over $298 billion, or 121%.

The hyperloop could also mean that between 20,000 and 24,000 fewer flights would be needed at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol by 2040. Hardt also says the hyperloop would use less energy per passenger than a train or plane; Elon Musk has even suggested putting solar panels on hyperloops to power them.

Jeroen Olthof, the deputy responsible for mobility in North Holland, said that people were willing to travel up to an hour to get to work, and a hyperloop would let them travel much farther in that time. He called the idea of a hyperloop "very promising."

Hardt Hyperloop is building a 3 kilometer test track in the Dutch province of Groningen to continue researching the technology.
In the past 30 years, the world has lost more than one quarter of its insects that live on or over land, according to a study in the journal Science.

From bees to butterflies, bugs are disappearing at a rate of just under 1% a year, with lots of variation from place to place. That's less of a decrease than found by some smaller, local studies, which had raised fears of an "insect apocalypse."

But it's still alarming, said Roel van Klink, the study's lead author.

The study looked at earlier research on more than 10,000 types of insects with data from 1,676 locations. The largest global decreases seem to be around cities, suburbs and croplands, where bugs are losing their food and habitat, van Klink said.

Insect decreases are worst in North America, especially the Midwestern United States, and in parts of Europe.

The study noted very different rates of decrease from place to place and from decade to decade. David Wagner, a scientist who wasn't part of the study, said this means there is more than one factor causing the drop in insect numbers.

However, while land bugs were decreasing, freshwater insects, such as dragonflies and mosquitoes, are increasing at more than 1% a year, the study found. That's faster than land bugs were disappearing. However, those freshwater insects are a tiny percentage of bugs in the world.

But that improvement of freshwater insects, likely because rivers and streams got cleaner, shows hope, scientists said.
